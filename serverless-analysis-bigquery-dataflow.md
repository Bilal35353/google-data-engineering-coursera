# Serverless Data Analysis with Google BigQuery and Cloud Dataflow 

## Welcome to Serverless Data Analysis with Google BigQuery and Cloud Dataflow

Basically, this course is as the title says it is. 

## Module 1: Serverless Data Analysis with BigQuery

* BigQuery is cool - Petabyte scale DB at almost Real-Time
* Pay for the amount of data your process (basically by query) 
* SQL 2011
* Storage is seperate - Google Cloud Storage
* Can process JSON 
* Fully managed, "cluster free" 
* Imutable audit logs 
* Can share queries 
* Columnar
